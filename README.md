# ChromeExtensionExample
Working from a (broken) tutorial, learning how to create a Google Chrome extension which allows bookmarking of specific parts of Youtube videos.
To check out this Little project download my repo.
Then, while using chrome, go to the manage extensions tab and turn on "developer mode"
Then click on load unpacked and select the folder of my repo that was donwloaded.
Pin the new extension and go to any public youtube video.
You will now see a plus sign by the autoplay button. This will allow you to make a bookmark of the video when the button is hit.
Clicking on the extension icon while the page for the video is up will allow the user to skip right to the bookmarked part of the video, or delete the bookmark
